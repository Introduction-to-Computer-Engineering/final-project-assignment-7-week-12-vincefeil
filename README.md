## Original-guide.js
### Operation
This is code copied from Spark Fun. It turns three LEDs on and off by varying the intensity.

## enable-matrix.js
### Operation
This code turns three external LEDs and the center LED on the display on and off. This demonstrates the matrix is not disabled.

## twenty-eight.js
### Operation
This code conbines the external LEDs and the screen saver Arrows. It turns the three external LEDs on and of as it does in enable-matrix but, when button A is pressed the Arrows screen saver runs for five seconds.

## digital-in.js
### Operation

This code uses an external button to turn an external and onboard LED on and off. When the button is pressed the LEDs come on and stay on until the button is pressed again. Each time the button is pressed the LEDs turn on or off depending on the state they are in at the time.

## manual-calibration.js
### Operation

This code uses a Spark Fun soil moisture sensor to read the dampness of a material and shows a bar grapf similar to the power bar graph on a cel phone. The reading from the sensor is remaped to give a range of zero to for and uses this range for the display output. It was calibrated manualy by observing the reading of dry and saturated through the serial port. I used ny finger in the video to demonstrate the change in moisture that changes the display.
